Pop'n Touch: Revengeance
========================

**Pop'n Touch: Revengeance** is a **multiplayer music-driven game** with a
music theory learning aspect, developed for the touch table Microsoft PixelSense
by a team of 4th year engineering students in Computer Science at INSA Rennes.
Our goal is to let the users, alone or in group, challenge their rhythm sense
and their ability to rapidly recognize notes on a sheet music. We'd like
everybody to be able to discover solfège, compete against or play with friends,
and all that in an innovative environment. **Will you be able to get an ace?**

> **There's nothing remarkable about it. All one has to do is hit the right keys
at the right time and the instrument plays itself.**  
> — Johann Sebastian Bach

Microsoft PixelSense
--------------------
Targeting Samsung-built Microsoft PixelSense touch tables, our application is
entirely written in C# and XAML. To this end, we conform to Microsoft's good
development practises and tools, and apply MVVM design pattern.
