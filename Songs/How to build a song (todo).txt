You want to add a sheet for an awesome song you know to the awesome game Pop'n'Touch 2 ?
Here is what to do in a few steps :

1. If the song doesn't already exists, create a directory with the song's name
2. In the directory, add a ".song" file named like this : "instrument difficulty"
   For example, "voice beginner.song" is a correctly named file.
   The instrument may be what you want, but there are only three different difficulties : beginner, classic, and expert.
3. Once your file is created, you need to fil it with the notes of your sheet. It may be fastidious !
   You need to add a line for each note the sheet will have.
   The lines must be like this : "length_of_the_note accidental_of_the_note height_of_the_note".
   The different values of each parameter are listed below.
   Note the rest is considered a note !
	Length : whole, half, quarter, eighth
	Accidental : None, flat, sharp
	Height : do, re mi, fa, sol, la, si, rest
4. Bonus todo

The file "easy beginner.song" in the "au clair de la lune" directory is a correct example of what you must do.

If your sheet is badly created, the game will lauch but you won't be able to play as the sheet will be empty, so be careful !
