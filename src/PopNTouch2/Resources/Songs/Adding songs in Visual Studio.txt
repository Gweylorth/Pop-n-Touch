This is not the same tutorial as "How to add songs or instruments.txt" (will be referred to as [HowTo] in the rest of this file).
[HowTo] targets end-users so that they can add songs to Pop'n'Touch after release.

This file targets developers wishing to add songs to be shipped with Pop'n'Touch release.

1. In Visual Studio, go to "PopNTouch2/Resources/Songs".
2. Right-click on "Songs" and add a new folder with the name of your song.
3. Right-click on the new folder and add a new Text File item called "meta.data". Fill it as described in [HowTo].
4. Do the same for every couple of instrument/difficulty you wish to add and name them "Instrument-Difficulty.sheet". Fill them as described in [HowTo].
5. For every text file created, you need to make sure that:
   - The "Copy to output directory" property is "Copy always";
   - The "Build action" property is "None."
   Else it won't be included in the release.
   You also may want to check for each file that in File\Advanced Save Options, Line Endings are set to CRLF (enables easy edition using Notepad on Windows).

That's about it.
