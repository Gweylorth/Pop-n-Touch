Missing your favorite song in Pop'n'Touch 2?
Missing an instrument for an awesome song?

Here is what to do to fix it right away:

1. If the song does not already exist, create a directory with the song's name.
2. If it is a new song, in the song's directory, add a new text file named "meta.data" (beware of the extension! It must be ".data" and not ".txt").
   This file describes your song in 4 lines:
     Title
	 Author
	 Year
   Example:
     Au Clair de la Lune
     Anonyme
     17XX
3. In the song's directory, add a new text file named after the convention "Instrument-Difficulty.sheet" (beware of the extension! It must be ".sheet" and not ".txt").
   For example, "Guitar-Beginner.song" is a valid filename referring to the sheet for a Guitar at Beginner level.
   Available instruments:
     - Guitar;
     - Violin;
     - Piano.
   Valid difficulties:
     - Beginner;
	 - Classic;
	 - Expert.
   You can add as many Instrument-Difficulty couples as you want!
4. Once a sheet file is created, you need to fill it with the notes. It may be fastidious!
   You need to add one line for each and every note the sheet will have.
   The lines must follow the convention "Length_of_the_note Accidental_of_the_note Height_of_the_note".
   For example, "Whole None Fa" is a valid note referring to a whole Fa without any accidental.
   The file "Guitar-Beginner.sheet" for "Au Clair de la Lune" is a simple and complete example of what you must do.
   Be careful: rests are treated as notes and should be mentioned!

   Valid values:
     - Length: Whole, Half, Quarter, Eighth;
     - Accidental: None, Flat, Sharp;
     - Height: Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si, Rest.
5. Bonus todo

If your sheet is poorly written and does not respect the conventions, you may not be able to play your new music/instrument, so be careful!
